This repo is inspired from "Jon Krohn's Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning course availbable on Udemy".</br>
It has a comprehensive overview of different ML foundation topics and Algorithms, i have came across during the course.</br>
Original repo create by JON KROHN is also available on this url "https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations".</br>
</br>
</br>
This repo is divide into Four parts:</br>
1.Linear Algebra</br>
2.Calculus</br>
3.Probability and Statistics</br>
4.Algorithms,Data Structures and Optimization.</br>
</br>
</br>
If you are beginner and  new to computer science then i would advise you to go through Jon Krohn's repo and if have a introductory knowledge to Machine learning and pace up a bit Then these repo might be helpful to you.</br>
